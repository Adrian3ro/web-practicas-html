    <div style="border: 1px solid black">Hello World</div>
    <p>
      The DIV element is a block element, and will always start on a new line
      and take up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right
      as far as it can).
    </p>

    <p>
      This is an inline span
      <span style="border: 1px solid black">Hello World</span> element inside a
      paragraph.
    </p>
    <p>
      The SPAN element is an inline element, and will not start on a new line
      and only takes up as much width as necessary.
